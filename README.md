# Fall 2021 BYUI Data Science Society TrelliscopeJS Project
### DSS Team Members:

- Cam Miller

## Introduction:
### Who We and DSS Are
Brigham Young Idaho universities Data Science Society is compromised of Students that are driven by curiosity and interested in how data-driven decisions are made and those that have an eye for visualization and how information is communicated. The single mission of the BYUI Data Science Society is to build employable skills for careers related to data science.
### The Use Case We came up with
The Primary purpose of focusing on the Trelliscope RStudio package was to create an image labeling tool that Data Scientists could use to help correctly label image data. Those who have created and completed CNN Projects know that labeling images can be a long and tedious process, the hope of this project was to help make image labeling less tedious. 
### Eventually... the use cases out team members did

## Getting Started Installation and Requirements
```
# In order to download the package you must download the package use the following code in an RSCript or MD file
devtools::install_github("hafen/trelliscopejs@sheldon")
library(trelliscopejs)
```
## Documentation
(Any links we used.  Links Chris/Ryan provided.  Team Members personal trelliscope repos if any.)
Here is a link to a [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trelliscopejs/vignettes/trelliscopejs.html) on how trelliscope is used for data exploration with its multiplot function. 



### How much we get paid
*Not enough* 

## File Preparation
**Not only what was done, but why it was done?**
### Python Notebook Explanation

### CSVs and Data/Images used
One very short and simple example can be used with 
## Actual R/TrelliscopeJS Stuff
**Not only what was done, but why it was done?**
### Maybe Explain the Examples from him that gave us inspiration &trade;
### Street View
### Cats Dogs
This is a very short example of how to use Trelliscope for labeling cat and dog images. In this short and brief example there is an file that contains images of cats and dogs. In the dog file there is a picture of a cat(mislabeling). The tutorial shows how to use trelliscope to correctly label the image and move it to the appropriate folder. 

## If we had more time/money/energy what we would do?
